Google DeepMind trains an "advanced Gemini model with Deep Think" that is officially certified to achieve Gold performance at the International Math Olympiad, done purely in token space under human rules (whereas 2024's Silver needed a AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry model and over 60 hours). Same model later wins IOI, ICPC and IOAA gold.
